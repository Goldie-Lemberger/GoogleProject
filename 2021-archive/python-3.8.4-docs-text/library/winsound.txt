"winsound" --- Sound-playing interface for Windows
**************************************************

======================================================================

The "winsound" module provides access to the basic sound-playing
machinery provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and
several constants.

winsound.Beep(frequency, duration)

   Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies
   frequency, in hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37
   through 32,767. The *duration* parameter specifies the number of
   milliseconds the sound should last.  If the system is not able to
   beep the speaker, "RuntimeError" is raised.

winsound.PlaySound(sound, flags)

   Call the underlying "PlaySound()" function from the Platform API.
   The *sound* parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias,
   audio data as a *bytes-like object*, or "None".  Its interpretation
   depends on the value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed
   combination of the constants described below. If the *sound*
   parameter is "None", any currently playing waveform sound is
   stopped. If the system indicates an error, "RuntimeError" is
   raised.

winsound.MessageBeep(type=MB_OK)

   Call the underlying "MessageBeep()" function from the Platform API.
   This plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The *type*
   argument specifies which sound to play; possible values are "-1",
   "MB_ICONASTERISK", "MB_ICONEXCLAMATION", "MB_ICONHAND",
   "MB_ICONQUESTION", and "MB_OK", all described below.  The value
   "-1" produces a "simple beep"; this is the final fallback if a
   sound cannot be played otherwise.  If the system indicates an
   error, "RuntimeError" is raised.

winsound.SND_FILENAME

   The *sound* parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with
   "SND_ALIAS".

winsound.SND_ALIAS

   The *sound* parameter is a sound association name from the
   registry.  If the registry contains no such name, play the system
   default sound unless "SND_NODEFAULT" is also specified. If no
   default sound is registered, raise "RuntimeError". Do not use with
   "SND_FILENAME".

   All Win32 systems support at least the following; most systems
   support many more:

   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "PlaySound()" *name*       | Corresponding Control Panel Sound name   |
   |============================|==========================================|
   | "'SystemAsterisk'"         | Asterisk                                 |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemExclamation'"      | Exclamation                              |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemExit'"             | Exit Windows                             |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemHand'"             | Critical Stop                            |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+
   | "'SystemQuestion'"         | Question                                 |
   +----------------------------+------------------------------------------+

   For example:

      import winsound
      # Play Windows exit sound.
      winsound.PlaySound("SystemExit", winsound.SND_ALIAS)

      # Probably play Windows default sound, if any is registered (because
      # "*" probably isn't the registered name of any sound).
      winsound.PlaySound("*", winsound.SND_ALIAS)

winsound.SND_LOOP

   Play the sound repeatedly.  The "SND_ASYNC" flag must also be used
   to avoid blocking.  Cannot be used with "SND_MEMORY".

winsound.SND_MEMORY

   The *sound* parameter to "PlaySound()" is a memory image of a WAV
   file, as a *bytes-like object*.

   Note:

     This module does not support playing from a memory image
     asynchronously, so a combination of this flag and "SND_ASYNC"
     will raise "RuntimeError".

winsound.SND_PURGE

   Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.

   Note:

     This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

winsound.SND_ASYNC

   Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.

winsound.SND_NODEFAULT

   If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play the system
   default sound.

winsound.SND_NOSTOP

   Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.

winsound.SND_NOWAIT

   Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.

   Note:

     This flag is not supported on modern Windows platforms.

winsound.MB_ICONASTERISK

   Play the "SystemDefault" sound.

winsound.MB_ICONEXCLAMATION

   Play the "SystemExclamation" sound.

winsound.MB_ICONHAND

   Play the "SystemHand" sound.

winsound.MB_ICONQUESTION

   Play the "SystemQuestion" sound.

winsound.MB_OK

   Play the "SystemDefault" sound.
