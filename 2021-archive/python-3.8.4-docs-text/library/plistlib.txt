"plistlib" --- Generate and parse Mac OS X ".plist" files
*********************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/plistlib.py

======================================================================

This module provides an interface for reading and writing the
"property list" files used mainly by Mac OS X and supports both binary
and XML plist files.

The property list (".plist") file format is a simple serialization
supporting basic object types, like dictionaries, lists, numbers and
strings.  Usually the top level object is a dictionary.

To write out and to parse a plist file, use the "dump()" and "load()"
functions.

To work with plist data in bytes objects, use "dumps()" and "loads()".

Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, lists,
dictionaries (but only with string keys), "Data", "bytes",
"bytesarray" or "datetime.datetime" objects.

Changed in version 3.4: New API, old API deprecated.  Support for
binary format plists added.

Changed in version 3.8: Support added for reading and writing "UID"
tokens in binary plists as used by NSKeyedArchiver and
NSKeyedUnarchiver.

  PList manual page
     Apple's documentation of the file format.

This module defines the following functions:

plistlib.load(fp, *, fmt=None, use_builtin_types=True, dict_type=dict)

   Read a plist file. *fp* should be a readable and binary file
   object. Return the unpacked root object (which usually is a
   dictionary).

   The *fmt* is the format of the file and the following values are
   valid:

   * "None": Autodetect the file format

   * "FMT_XML": XML file format

   * "FMT_BINARY": Binary plist format

   If *use_builtin_types* is true (the default) binary data will be
   returned as instances of "bytes", otherwise it is returned as
   instances of "Data".

   The *dict_type* is the type used for dictionaries that are read
   from the plist file.

   XML data for the "FMT_XML" format is parsed using the Expat parser
   from "xml.parsers.expat" -- see its documentation for possible
   exceptions on ill-formed XML.  Unknown elements will simply be
   ignored by the plist parser.

   The parser for the binary format raises "InvalidFileException" when
   the file cannot be parsed.

   New in version 3.4.

plistlib.loads(data, *, fmt=None, use_builtin_types=True, dict_type=dict)

   Load a plist from a bytes object. See "load()" for an explanation
   of the keyword arguments.

   New in version 3.4.

plistlib.dump(value, fp, *, fmt=FMT_XML, sort_keys=True, skipkeys=False)

   Write *value* to a plist file. *Fp* should be a writable, binary
   file object.

   The *fmt* argument specifies the format of the plist file and can
   be one of the following values:

   * "FMT_XML": XML formatted plist file

   * "FMT_BINARY": Binary formatted plist file

   When *sort_keys* is true (the default) the keys for dictionaries
   will be written to the plist in sorted order, otherwise they will
   be written in the iteration order of the dictionary.

   When *skipkeys* is false (the default) the function raises
   "TypeError" when a key of a dictionary is not a string, otherwise
   such keys are skipped.

   A "TypeError" will be raised if the object is of an unsupported
   type or a container that contains objects of unsupported types.

   An "OverflowError" will be raised for integer values that cannot be
   represented in (binary) plist files.

   New in version 3.4.

plistlib.dumps(value, *, fmt=FMT_XML, sort_keys=True, skipkeys=False)

   Return *value* as a plist-formatted bytes object. See the
   documentation for "dump()" for an explanation of the keyword
   arguments of this function.

   New in version 3.4.

The following functions are deprecated:

plistlib.readPlist(pathOrFile)

   Read a plist file. *pathOrFile* may be either a file name or a
   (readable and binary) file object. Returns the unpacked root object
   (which usually is a dictionary).

   This function calls "load()" to do the actual work, see the
   documentation of "that function" for an explanation of the keyword
   arguments.

   Deprecated since version 3.4: Use "load()" instead.

   Changed in version 3.7: Dict values in the result are now normal
   dicts.  You no longer can use attribute access to access items of
   these dictionaries.

plistlib.writePlist(rootObject, pathOrFile)

   Write *rootObject* to an XML plist file. *pathOrFile* may be either
   a file name or a (writable and binary) file object

   Deprecated since version 3.4: Use "dump()" instead.

plistlib.readPlistFromBytes(data)

   Read a plist data from a bytes object.  Return the root object.

   See "load()" for a description of the keyword arguments.

   Deprecated since version 3.4: Use "loads()" instead.

   Changed in version 3.7: Dict values in the result are now normal
   dicts.  You no longer can use attribute access to access items of
   these dictionaries.

plistlib.writePlistToBytes(rootObject)

   Return *rootObject* as an XML plist-formatted bytes object.

   Deprecated since version 3.4: Use "dumps()" instead.

The following classes are available:

class plistlib.Data(data)

   Return a "data" wrapper object around the bytes object *data*.
   This is used in functions converting from/to plists to represent
   the "<data>" type available in plists.

   It has one attribute, "data", that can be used to retrieve the
   Python bytes object stored in it.

   Deprecated since version 3.4: Use a "bytes" object instead.

class plistlib.UID(data)

   Wraps an "int".  This is used when reading or writing
   NSKeyedArchiver encoded data, which contains UID (see PList
   manual).

   It has one attribute, "data", which can be used to retrieve the int
   value of the UID.  "data" must be in the range *0 <= data < 2**64*.

   New in version 3.8.

The following constants are available:

plistlib.FMT_XML

   The XML format for plist files.

   New in version 3.4.

plistlib.FMT_BINARY

   The binary format for plist files

   New in version 3.4.


Examples
========

Generating a plist:

   pl = dict(
       aString = "Doodah",
       aList = ["A", "B", 12, 32.1, [1, 2, 3]],
       aFloat = 0.1,
       anInt = 728,
       aDict = dict(
           anotherString = "<hello & hi there!>",
           aThirdString = "M\xe4ssig, Ma\xdf",
           aTrueValue = True,
           aFalseValue = False,
       ),
       someData = b"<binary gunk>",
       someMoreData = b"<lots of binary gunk>" * 10,
       aDate = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(time.mktime(time.gmtime())),
   )
   with open(fileName, 'wb') as fp:
       dump(pl, fp)

Parsing a plist:

   with open(fileName, 'rb') as fp:
       pl = load(fp)
   print(pl["aKey"])
