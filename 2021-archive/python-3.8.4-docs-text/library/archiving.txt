Data Compression and Archiving
******************************

The modules described in this chapter support data compression with
the zlib, gzip, bzip2 and lzma algorithms, and the creation of ZIP-
and tar-format archives.  See also Archiving operations provided by
the "shutil" module.

* "zlib" --- Compression compatible with **gzip**

* "gzip" --- Support for **gzip** files

  * Examples of usage

  * Command Line Interface

    * Command line options

* "bz2" --- Support for **bzip2** compression

  * (De)compression of files

  * Incremental (de)compression

  * One-shot (de)compression

  * Examples of usage

* "lzma" --- Compression using the LZMA algorithm

  * Reading and writing compressed files

  * Compressing and decompressing data in memory

  * Miscellaneous

  * Specifying custom filter chains

  * Examples

* "zipfile" --- Work with ZIP archives
