"tabnanny" --- Detection of ambiguous indentation
*************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/tabnanny.py

======================================================================

For the time being this module is intended to be called as a script.
However it is possible to import it into an IDE and use the function
"check()" described below.

Note:

  The API provided by this module is likely to change in future
  releases; such changes may not be backward compatible.

tabnanny.check(file_or_dir)

   If *file_or_dir* is a directory and not a symbolic link, then
   recursively descend the directory tree named by *file_or_dir*,
   checking all ".py" files along the way.  If *file_or_dir* is an
   ordinary Python source file, it is checked for whitespace related
   problems.  The diagnostic messages are written to standard output
   using the "print()" function.

tabnanny.verbose

   Flag indicating whether to print verbose messages. This is
   incremented by the "-v" option if called as a script.

tabnanny.filename_only

   Flag indicating whether to print only the filenames of files
   containing whitespace related problems.  This is set to true by the
   "-q" option if called as a script.

exception tabnanny.NannyNag

   Raised by "process_tokens()" if detecting an ambiguous indent.
   Captured and handled in "check()".

tabnanny.process_tokens(tokens)

   This function is used by "check()" to process tokens generated by
   the "tokenize" module.
