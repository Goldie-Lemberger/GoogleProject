Functional Programming Modules
******************************

The modules described in this chapter provide functions and classes
that support a functional programming style, and general operations on
callables.

The following modules are documented in this chapter:

* "itertools" --- Functions creating iterators for efficient looping

  * Itertool functions

  * Itertools Recipes

* "functools" --- Higher-order functions and operations on callable
  objects

  * "partial" Objects

* "operator" --- Standard operators as functions

  * Mapping Operators to Functions

  * In-place Operators
