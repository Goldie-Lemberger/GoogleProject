"asyncio" --- Asynchronous I/O
******************************

======================================================================


Hello World!
^^^^^^^^^^^^

   import asyncio

   async def main():
       print('Hello ...')
       await asyncio.sleep(1)
       print('... World!')

   # Python 3.7+
   asyncio.run(main())

asyncio is a library to write **concurrent** code using the
**async/await** syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous
frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers,
database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level
**structured** network code.

asyncio provides a set of **high-level** APIs to:

* run Python coroutines concurrently and have full control over their
  execution;

* perform network IO and IPC;

* control subprocesses;

* distribute tasks via queues;

* synchronize concurrent code;

Additionally, there are **low-level** APIs for *library and framework
developers* to:

* create and manage event loops, which provide asynchronous APIs for
  "networking", running "subprocesses", handling "OS signals", etc;

* implement efficient protocols using transports;

* bridge callback-based libraries and code with async/await syntax.
