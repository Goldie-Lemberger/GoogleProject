"quopri" --- Encode and decode MIME quoted-printable data
*********************************************************

**Source code:** Lib/quopri.py

======================================================================

This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding,
as defined in **RFC 1521**: "MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the
Format of Internet Message Bodies". The quoted-printable encoding is
designed for data where there are relatively few nonprintable
characters; the base64 encoding scheme available via the "base64"
module is more compact if there are many such characters, as when
sending a graphics file.

quopri.decode(input, output, header=False)

   Decode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting
   decoded binary data to the *output* file. *input* and *output* must
   be *binary file objects*.  If the optional argument *header* is
   present and true, underscore will be decoded as space. This is used
   to decode "Q"-encoded headers as described in **RFC 1522**: "MIME
   (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Two: Message Header
   Extensions for Non-ASCII Text".

quopri.encode(input, output, quotetabs, header=False)

   Encode the contents of the *input* file and write the resulting
   quoted-printable data to the *output* file. *input* and *output*
   must be *binary file objects*. *quotetabs*, a non-optional flag
   which controls whether to encode embedded spaces and tabs; when
   true it encodes such embedded whitespace, and when false it leaves
   them unencoded. Note that spaces and tabs appearing at the end of
   lines are always encoded, as per **RFC 1521**.  *header* is a flag
   which controls if spaces are encoded as underscores as per **RFC
   1522**.

quopri.decodestring(s, header=False)

   Like "decode()", except that it accepts a source "bytes" and
   returns the corresponding decoded "bytes".

quopri.encodestring(s, quotetabs=False, header=False)

   Like "encode()", except that it accepts a source "bytes" and
   returns the corresponding encoded "bytes". By default, it sends a
   "False" value to *quotetabs* parameter of the "encode()" function.
