"sndhdr" --- Determine type of sound file
*****************************************

**Source code:** Lib/sndhdr.py

======================================================================

The "sndhdr" provides utility functions which attempt to determine the
type of sound data which is in a file.  When these functions are able
to determine what type of sound data is stored in a file, they return
a "namedtuple()", containing five attributes: ("filetype",
"framerate", "nchannels", "nframes", "sampwidth"). The value for
*type* indicates the data type and will be one of the strings
"'aifc'", "'aiff'", "'au'", "'hcom'", "'sndr'", "'sndt'", "'voc'",
"'wav'", "'8svx'", "'sb'", "'ub'", or "'ul'".  The *sampling_rate*
will be either the actual value or "0" if unknown or difficult to
decode.  Similarly, *channels* will be either the number of channels
or "0" if it cannot be determined or if the value is difficult to
decode.  The value for *frames* will be either the number of frames or
"-1".  The last item in the tuple, *bits_per_sample*, will either be
the sample size in bits or "'A'" for A-LAW or "'U'" for u-LAW.

sndhdr.what(filename)

   Determines the type of sound data stored in the file *filename*
   using "whathdr()".  If it succeeds, returns a namedtuple as
   described above, otherwise "None" is returned.

   Changed in version 3.5: Result changed from a tuple to a
   namedtuple.

sndhdr.whathdr(filename)

   Determines the type of sound data stored in a file based on the
   file  header. The name of the file is given by *filename*.  This
   function returns a namedtuple as described above on success, or
   "None".

   Changed in version 3.5: Result changed from a tuple to a
   namedtuple.
