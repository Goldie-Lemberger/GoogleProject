"html" --- HyperText Markup Language support
********************************************

**Source code:** Lib/html/__init__.py

======================================================================

This module defines utilities to manipulate HTML.

html.escape(s, quote=True)

   Convert the characters "&", "<" and ">" in string *s* to HTML-safe
   sequences.  Use this if you need to display text that might contain
   such characters in HTML.  If the optional flag *quote* is true, the
   characters (""") and ("'") are also translated; this helps for
   inclusion in an HTML attribute value delimited by quotes, as in "<a
   href="...">".

   New in version 3.2.

html.unescape(s)

   Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g. "&gt;",
   "&#62;", "&#x3e;") in the string *s* to the corresponding Unicode
   characters.  This function uses the rules defined by the HTML 5
   standard for both valid and invalid character references, and the
   "list of HTML 5 named character references".

   New in version 3.4.

======================================================================
