List Objects
************

PyListObject

   This subtype of "PyObject" represents a Python list object.

PyTypeObject PyList_Type

   This instance of "PyTypeObject" represents the Python list type.
   This is the same object as "list" in the Python layer.

int PyList_Check(PyObject *p)

   Return true if *p* is a list object or an instance of a subtype of
   the list type.

int PyList_CheckExact(PyObject *p)

   Return true if *p* is a list object, but not an instance of a
   subtype of the list type.

PyObject* PyList_New(Py_ssize_t len)
    *Return value: New reference.*

   Return a new list of length *len* on success, or "NULL" on failure.

   Note:

     If *len* is greater than zero, the returned list object's items
     are set to "NULL".  Thus you cannot use abstract API functions
     such as "PySequence_SetItem()"  or expose the object to Python
     code before setting all items to a real object with
     "PyList_SetItem()".

Py_ssize_t PyList_Size(PyObject *list)

   Return the length of the list object in *list*; this is equivalent
   to "len(list)" on a list object.

Py_ssize_t PyList_GET_SIZE(PyObject *list)

   Macro form of "PyList_Size()" without error checking.

PyObject* PyList_GetItem(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t index)
    *Return value: Borrowed reference.*

   Return the object at position *index* in the list pointed to by
   *list*.  The position must be non-negative; indexing from the end
   of the list is not supported.  If *index* is out of bounds (<0 or
   >=len(list)), return "NULL" and set an "IndexError" exception.

PyObject* PyList_GET_ITEM(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t i)
    *Return value: Borrowed reference.*

   Macro form of "PyList_GetItem()" without error checking.

int PyList_SetItem(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t index, PyObject *item)

   Set the item at index *index* in list to *item*.  Return "0" on
   success. If *index* is out of bounds, return "-1" and set an
   "IndexError" exception.

   Note:

     This function "steals" a reference to *item* and discards a
     reference to an item already in the list at the affected
     position.

void PyList_SET_ITEM(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t i, PyObject *o)

   Macro form of "PyList_SetItem()" without error checking. This is
   normally only used to fill in new lists where there is no previous
   content.

   Note:

     This macro "steals" a reference to *item*, and, unlike
     "PyList_SetItem()", does *not* discard a reference to any item
     that is being replaced; any reference in *list* at position *i*
     will be leaked.

int PyList_Insert(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t index, PyObject *item)

   Insert the item *item* into list *list* in front of index *index*.
   Return "0" if successful; return "-1" and set an exception if
   unsuccessful. Analogous to "list.insert(index, item)".

int PyList_Append(PyObject *list, PyObject *item)

   Append the object *item* at the end of list *list*. Return "0" if
   successful; return "-1" and set an exception if unsuccessful.
   Analogous to "list.append(item)".

PyObject* PyList_GetSlice(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t low, Py_ssize_t high)
    *Return value: New reference.*

   Return a list of the objects in *list* containing the objects
   *between* *low* and *high*.  Return "NULL" and set an exception if
   unsuccessful.  Analogous to "list[low:high]".  Indexing from the
   end of the list is not supported.

int PyList_SetSlice(PyObject *list, Py_ssize_t low, Py_ssize_t high, PyObject *itemlist)

   Set the slice of *list* between *low* and *high* to the contents of
   *itemlist*.  Analogous to "list[low:high] = itemlist". The
   *itemlist* may be "NULL", indicating the assignment of an empty
   list (slice deletion). Return "0" on success, "-1" on failure.
   Indexing from the end of the list is not supported.

int PyList_Sort(PyObject *list)

   Sort the items of *list* in place.  Return "0" on success, "-1" on
   failure.  This is equivalent to "list.sort()".

int PyList_Reverse(PyObject *list)

   Reverse the items of *list* in place.  Return "0" on success, "-1"
   on failure.  This is the equivalent of "list.reverse()".

PyObject* PyList_AsTuple(PyObject *list)
    *Return value: New reference.*

   Return a new tuple object containing the contents of *list*;
   equivalent to "tuple(list)".

int PyList_ClearFreeList()

   Clear the free list. Return the total number of freed items.

   New in version 3.3.
